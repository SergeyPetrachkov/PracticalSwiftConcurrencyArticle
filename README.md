## Introduction to Swift Concurrency

Swift Concurrency was introduced to us along with Swift 5.5. The initial goal was to make the concurrency easier and reduce the steepness of the learning curve that GCD has. However, the new stuff has turned out to be way more complex and given birth to some huge misunderstanding accross the industry. But we'll get there.

Let's first talk about the swift concurrency as it was presented to us. Instead of closures or publishers we can now `await` functions and properties that have an `async` next to them.

```Swift
func longOperation() async -> Bool {
    // ...
    return true
}
// ...
let result = await longOperation()
```

Is it Swift Concurrency? Well, absolutely. Does this snippet have any value? Well, I don't think so.
In some sense Swift Concurrency reminds me of C# .NET, where I witnessed the introduction of async-await. And the common denominator back then was "Once you go async in one place, you can't go back".

**You cannot `await` anything outside of the concurrent context.** 
This is very important to embrace. 

**How do I enter the concurrent context?**
or 
**Where do I enter the concurrent context?**

These are the two questions that are often missed. The answers to these questions define the architectural shift in how we see iOS/macOS/watchOS/visionOS/whateverOS apps and the code we write.
But let's go step by step.

### How do I enter the concurrent context?
Well, for that you need to have a `Task`. You can read the implementation details [here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/main/stdlib/public/Concurrency/Task.swift).
But in short: `Task` is a struct. This struct has a few versions of initialisers where you specify an `async` closure and a priority (if needed). The contents of this closure are your concurrent context. Inside this closure you can `await` async operations. You can also specify an actor isolation (we'll talk about it later). As in any closure, you can also capture some objects via capture groups. 
In some sense, `Task` initialiser is one of the most important things in the whole Swift Concurrency. It's an entry point for us - consumers of the framework. Then the job described in the closure gets dispatched to an associated executor. If you want to read more about the under-the-hood of Swift Concurrency I encourage you to:
1) Read this article: https://swiftrocks.com/how-async-await-works-internally-in-swift
2) Clone [Swift](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main) and do you own research, it's highly entertaining.

But to keep it short and to avoid repeating what's already been described, we're not gonna dive deeper into that now.

So, practical answer to `how do I enter the concurrent context`:
We need to create a Task. In Swift when you create a Task, it starts running immediately (unlike in C#).

```Swift
Task {
    let result = await longOperation()
}
```

Now we're talking. We have created an unstructured Task, we've started it (well, the concurrency engine has started it). Everything inside the closure of the task is retained by an executor (it's a bit more complex than this, but let's just forget for a moment about all the details). Once the task is finished, everything is released.

Does this snippet look good to you?
To me, it doesn't. It's super abstract and it doesn't give me an idea of how I can use this task in my iOS project.

Let's add a bit more context to it.

### The 4 don'ts of Swift Concurrency
Let's take a look at this code. It may not be perfect (far from it!), but it's the perfect illustration of **the 4 don'ts of Swift Concurrency**:

```Swift
final class MyViewModel {
// ...

    func viewDidLoad() {
       // ...
       task = Task { @MainActor in
          let result = try await longOperation()
          doSomething(with: result)
       }
    }
}
```


1) **Don't be deceived by selfless tasks** - we don't see any `self` keyword inside of the Task. But `self` will be retained implicitly.
2) **Don't believe in try without catch** - this code will compile just fine. We call a throwing function and we don't catch any errors. So, in this case, if the longOperations throws an error, we won't get our result. And we won't get the error. It will be "silently suppressed". Task can accept throwing closures, so be careful and don't forget to catch your errors ;)
   * **Tip!** It's nice to have Tasks that are one-liners. No lengthy logic. Just one function call. Then the compiler will help you not to miss this try-catch business and much more!
3) **Don't forget about the main thread** - in Swift Concurrency we don't operate threads directly, but it's important to keep in mind, that UI-related stuff must execute on the main thread. In Swift Concurrency we have Actors isolation mechanism that will make sure in compile time that certain code is executed on the main thread or outside of it. For the simplicity we can look at it as at a binary system: main/non-main thread. In this case inside the Task closure we have `@MainActor in`, which means that the execution **will start** on the main actor, when we `await` the `longOperation`, there will be a suspension point created and the work will be offloaded to one of the threads from the cooperative pool. Then, once the operation has finished, we'll get back to the main actor and execute `doSomething` on the main.
   * **Important!** This is fair only if the longOperation doesn't have MainActor isolation, and if there's no funky business like `DispatchQueue.main.async` somewhere there all of a sudden. So, **don't mix GCD with Swift Concurrency!**
   * **Important!** `await MainActor.run` is your last resort. It is only good if you need to build a bridge between the old world and the new Swift Concurrency. In your modern code try to avoid it. Rather try to design your entitities in a swift-concurrent way.
4) **Don't make your self weak** - I have to go through a lot of code in my day-to-day work. And I often see how people are tempted to put `[weak self]` inside the Task "just in case". And the next thing that they do is `guard let self else { return }`. We don't need that. There's no retain cycle there. Even if we hold the `task` in a property of `self` `Task` is not the one who holds the reference. The references are hold by Native.BuiltIn and once an executor finishes it's work (Task is finished/cancelled/error-thrown) the references will decrement and everything captured by it will be released (if nobody else is holding stuff).
   * **Important!** Rather than putting `[weak self]` there, think of how and when you're gonna **cancel** the task. If you don't trust me, trust the guys who invented [Swift Concurrency](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/c1ff2c339251c8adbdd63a08cb6ae45b339e15bd/stdlib/public/Concurrency/Task.swift#L80)

We can't properly cover this topic without touching the concept of isolation. We'll dive deeper into it later.

### Swift Concurrency. Where is the Concurrency?

In the [previous chapter](https://medium.com/@petrachkovsergey/the-4-donts-of-swift-concurrency-5614f39f8246) we've touched the topic of 4 don'ts of Swift Concurrency. We used the word Concurrency a lot. But how do we run our stuff **concurrently**?
We have a few options. In this article we'll take a look at those and say when we should use which one.

If we want to run things concurrently, we now have two instruments:
* async let syntax
* task groups (throwing/non-throwing/discarding)

One might say: we also have unstructured tasks. Well, yes, we do. But those are only good if we don't need to synchronize the execution and handle results. In most (if not all) cases we'd benefit from structured concurrency.

#### Async let

It is a special syntax sugar introduced in Swift 5.5 that allows use to start multiple async jobs in an async context and later await them as single values, or as a tuple, or as an array. You can find the detailed designs of async let [here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0317-async-let.md).

`Async let` is very convenient when you need to run a finite number of jobs that return values of different type, and then use those values somewhere. Under the hood it spawns a new Task that inherits the local context and actor isolation. It's recommended that you await it, otherwise you might end up with some unexpected (not unexpected anymore!) behavior as described [here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0317-async-let.md#async-let-error-propagation)

```Swift
// func boom() throws -> Int { throw Boom() }

func work() async -> Int {
  async let work: Int = boom()
  // never await work...
  return 0
  // implicitly: cancels work
  // implicitly: awaits work, discards errors
}
```

Okay, let's get practical.

Let's imagine that we are building a corporate tasks and builds tracker. We want to fetch details of a project and build versions that are associated with this project.
We can create a usecase like this:

```Swift
struct FetchProjectAndBuildsUseCase {

    private let versionsRepository: any VersionsRepository
    private let projectsRepository: any ProjectsRepository

    init(versionsRepository: any VersionsRepository, projectsRepository: any ProjectsRepository) {
        self.versionsRepository = versionsRepository
        self.projectsRepository = projectsRepository
    }

    func execute(projectId: Int) async throws -> (project: Project, versions: [Version]) {
        async let versions = versionsRepository.getVersions(request: .init(projectId: projectId))
        async let project = projectsRepository.getProject(by: projectId)

        let result = try await (project, versions)
        return result
    }
}
```

Things that you need to be aware of:
* the order of execution is not determined, we don't know if versions get downloaded before the project and vice versa. And we should not care about it! If we do, then we need to re-think how we organize this code.
* error handling is crucial here. If one of the tasks throws, then all the results will be lost.

#### Task Groups

Task groups are an essential part of Structured Concurrency. You can read the design doc [here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0304-structured-concurrency.md#task-groups-and-child-tasks). They can be [non-throwing, throwing](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0304-structured-concurrency.md#task-groups), and [discarding](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0381-task-group-discard-results.md).

Task groups are perfect when you need to execute potentially infinite number of operations that return the same result type (but the usecases are not limited to just that).

You may be tempted to use Swift Concurrency and task groups to load images in your media sync process or process media files. But be careful with that. If you use `UIImage`, you'll get RAM spikes because of how images are presented in memory. And you may also starve the threads in the cooperative pool. The number of the threads is fixed. So, **swift concurrency is not the best candidate for long and expensive operations**. [More can be found here](https://swiftrocks.com/how-async-await-works-internally-in-swift) and [here](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/libdispatch).

Let's get back to building our corporate task tracker. Let's say we need to download ticket details that are associated with a build.

1) We create a TaskGroup with a special function `withThrowingTaskGroup`.
2) We specify a return type of a **single** task within the group. It's gonna be an optional `Ticket`, because I don't care about the tickets that failed to decode for example (unless it's a network issue).
3) For each of the tickets I add a new task to the group by `group.addTask`. I try to load ticket details. If it's a network problem, I **throw a CancellationError which cancells the whole task group**. If it's a different issue I just print an error because I'm lazy ;)
4) Then I await the tasks via `for await` of `AsyncSequence`
5) And then I return the array of tickets.

```Swift
struct FetchTicketsUseCase {

    private let ticketsRepository: any TicketsRepository

    init(ticketsRepository: any TicketsRepository) {
        self.ticketsRepository = ticketsRepository
    }

    func execute(for version: Version) async throws -> [Ticket] {
        try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Ticket?.self) { group in
            for ticketKey in version.associatedTicketKeys {
                group.addTask {
                    do {
                        return try await ticketsRepository.getTicket(key: ticketKey)
                    } catch is URLError { // for the simplicity I use this to indicate the network error, but of course it's not 100% valid
                        throw CancellationError()
                    } catch {
                        print(error) // I'm lazy and I don't care about the errors :) 
                        return nil
                    }
                }
            }
            var tickets: [Ticket] = []
            for try await ticket in group {
                if let ticket {
                    tickets.append(ticket)
                }
            }
            return tickets
        }
    }
}
```

Important things to keep in mind:
* error handling is important, catch your errors or you'll lose the progress
* the order of execution is not determined: if we start tasks in this order: 1,2,3,4,5 we may get the results in any random order imaginable, so if you need your results sorted in the same order as you started the tasks, you have to do it yourself
* no child task can outlive it's parent, that's the beauty of structured concurrency. All tasks will be finished before you get back to the awaited task group.

P.S. 

Remember how people would ask questions like this during iOS interviews?

You need to execute multiple async operations and show the results in the same order as you enqueued those operations. How would you do that?

And then you'd start talking about how DispatchGroups are cool and stuff. 

Now, let's do it with swift concurrency.

```Swift
func loadSongsInfo(request: Request) async -> [SongInfo] {
        await withTaskGroup(of: (Int, SongInfo?).self) { group in
            for enumeratedSearcher in otherStreamingsSearchers.enumerated() {
                group.addTask {
                    do {
                        return try await (enumeratedSearcher.offset, enumeratedSearcher.element.search(request: request))
                    } catch {
                        return (enumeratedSearcher.offset, nil)
                    }
                }
            }
            var results: [(Int, SongInfo?)] = []
            for await result in group {
                results.append(result)
            }
            return results.sorted(by: { $0.0 < $1.0 }).compactMap { $0.1 }
        }
}
```

I hope you enjoyed this chapter. In the upcoming chapters we're finally going to talk about actors and we'll try to find an entry point into Concurrency in our iOS projects :)


### Actors, isolation, sendability: practical tips for iOS developers

With the new concurrency model, we've got quite a few new keywords and a bunch of concepts that we need to learn and adopt in our daily work. But it also brings fresh ideas to the concepts we've all been taught about one way or another. Let's go.

#### Thread safety.
Old but gold. The goal of Swift concurrency is to provide **compile-time safety**. In other words, the code that can cause data races (not race conditions) should not compile. It's achieved via actors model and the concept of sendability.

#### Sendability.
It's one of the most confusing parts for many developers. Let's not be too boring and get the practical side of it. When we say something is _sendable_, we mean that it's safe to pass that something between concurrency contexts (from one Task to another simply put). `Sendable` is just an empty protocol that acts as a marker for a compiler. When compiler sees a type that conforms to Sendable, it goes like this:

Aha, this type conforms to Sendable, let me do a quick check:
1) Is it an actor? If yes, then it's sendable by default. The nature of actors is that they are deadlock-free, datarace-safe. If it's not an actor, then we go further.
2) Is it a value type? (Struct or enum)? Value types are sendable, but sometimes you need to add the `: Sendable` explicitly, for example if you're dealing with modular apps and you have public structs defined in one module and you want to use them from another module. [More cases here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable#Sendable-Structures-and-Enumerations)
3) Is it a class? To satisfy the sendability requirements, the class must be final, contain no mutable shared state, contain only sendable properties, have no superclass (or only NSObject). There's one more way: if the class is isolated to the main actor. These classes can have stored properties that are mutable and nonsendable, because MainActor will take case of the thread-safety (we'll talk about it later). [More here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable#Sendable-Classes)
4) None of the above? Well, mate, no. It's not Sendable.

But what if you know that the class is thread-safe and you need the compiler to shut up? Then you can use `@unchecked Sendable`. You can put it to your class and it will be excluded from further checks. 
When can we use the unchecked sendable? **Ideally**, only when we are certain that the class is data-race free and we've achieved that via Locks or DispatchQueues or Atomics or any other way.
But sometimes we may use it in tests, when generating mocks for our interfaces. Most of the times we don't really need thread safe mocks, do we? (Unless we test multithreaded code).

When does Apple use unchecked Sendable?

You can check out [my article](https://medium.com/@petrachkovsergey/mutex-in-swift-lang-8d241db2e543) about Mutex<T> in Swift language. TL;DR it's a wrapper over os_unfair_lock (for iOS and macOS) and the wrapper is marked as unchecked Sendable :) 

But anyway, if we want to use Swift Concurrency, we can't skip the concept of sendability. Mostly because it's a building brick of the concept of Isolation.

#### Isolation



For now, let's find an entry point to the Concurrency for our iOS projects.

### Swift UI Entry point

If you're using SwiftUI and you're targeting recent iOS versions, then Apple have done the heavy lifting for you. 

Each and every SwiftUI view has a `.task {}` [modifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/task(priority:_:)) or even [this one](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/task(id:priority:_:)). This can be your entry point. And for the most of the apps it will be enough. 
```Swift
struct MyView: View {

  var body: some View {
     Text("Hello there")
       .task {
          // here you go
          let result = await longOperation()
       }
  }
}
```

Apple suggest using View layer of your app to be an entry point to the concurrency. And if you're using `task(id:priority:_:)` you get Tasks cancellation for free. 

### UIKit Entry point

But if you're using UIKit, the heavy lifting is on you. Depending on how you organize the presentation layer management, you need to choose which part of it will become the entry point. Is it going to be a ViewController (A View layer)? Or a ViewModel from MVVM, Interactor from VIP, Presenter from VIPER, or any other fancy word of your choosing.

It is important to align with your team(s) on how you see it. Some may say that the tests coverage of Tasks cancellation is an absolute must. Then moving it from View layer makes sense, because testing Views is usually more cumbersome than other layers.

### Paradigm shift

Remember I mentioned a paradigm shift in the beginning? Here we go. 
If you choose your View layer to be an entry point, then it may make sense to get your ViewModels or Interactors an async interface. (Note: I'm omitting any kind of actor-isolation code deliberately.)
What does it mean to us as developers? It means that we enetered the Concurrency really early and we can benefit from async-awaiting our way up (or down, depending on how you look at it) the scene stack. If our networking code, or repositories, or image processors, or any other things that are usually async use Swift Concurrency, then we can simply those async entities. No need to create unstructured tasks anywhere else. And a nice bonus with SwiftUI, the tasks will be cancelled automatically by SwiftUI engine when the view goes off the hierarchy. This will cover 90% of our requirements.

```Swift
@Observable
final class TasksViewModel {
    private(set) var items: [Item]
    // ...
    func start() async {
       items = await repository.fetchAll()
    }
}

struct TasksView: View {

  var viewModel: TasksViewModel

  var body: some View {
     List(viewModel.items) { item
        ItemRow(item)
     }
     .task {
        await viewModel.start()
     }
  }
}
```
