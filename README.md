## Introduction to Swift Concurrency

Swift Concurrency was introduced to us along with Swift 5.5. The initial goal was to make the concurrency easier and reduce the steepness of the learning curve that GCD has. However, the new stuff has turned out to be way more complex and given birth to some huge misunderstanding accross the industry. But we'll get there.

Let's first talk about the swift concurrency as it was presented to us. Instead of closures or publishers we can now `await` functions and properties that have an `async` next to them.

```Swift
func longOperation() async -> Bool {
    // ...
    return true
}
// ...
let result = await longOperation()
```

Is it Swift Concurrency? Well, absolutely. Does this snippet have any value? Well, I don't think so.
In some sense Swift Concurrency reminds me of C# .NET, where I witnessed the introduction of async-await. And the common denominator back then was "Once you go async in one place, you can't go back".

**You cannot `await` anything outside of the concurrent context.** 
This is very important to embrace. 

**How do I enter the concurrent context?**
or 
**Where do I enter the concurrent context?**

These are the two questions that are often missed. The answers to these questions define the architectural shift in how we see iOS/macOS/watchOS/visionOS/whateverOS apps and the code we write.
But let's go step by step.

### How do I enter the concurrent context?
Well, for that you need to have a `Task`. You can read the implementation details [here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/main/stdlib/public/Concurrency/Task.swift).
But in short: `Task` is a struct. This struct has a few versions of initialisers where you specify an `async` closure and a priority (if needed). The contents of this closure are your concurrent context. Inside this closure you can `await` async operations. You can also specify an actor isolation (we'll talk about it later). As in any closure, you can also capture some objects via capture groups. 
In some sense, `Task` initialiser is one of the most important things in the whole Swift Concurrency. It's an entry point for us - consumers of the framework. Then the job described in the closure gets dispatched to an associated executor. If you want to read more about the under-the-hood of Swift Concurrency I encourage you to:
1) Read this article: https://swiftrocks.com/how-async-await-works-internally-in-swift
2) Clone [Swift](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main) and do you own research, it's highly entertaining.

But to keep it short and to avoid repeating what's already been described, we're not gonna dive deeper into that now.

So, practical answer to `how do I enter the concurrent context`:
We need to create a Task. In Swift when you create a Task, it starts running immediately (unlike in C#).

```Swift
Task {
    let result = await longOperation()
}
```

Now we're talking. We have created an unstructured Task, we've started it (well, the concurrency engine has started it). Everything inside the closure of the task is retained by an executor (it's a bit more complex than this, but let's just forget for a moment about all the details). Once the task is finished, everything is released.

Does this snippet look good to you?
To me, it doesn't. It's super abstract and it doesn't give me an idea of how I can use this task in my iOS project.

Let's add a bit more context to it.

### The 4 don'ts of Swift Concurrency

```Swift
final class MyViewModel {
// ...

    func viewDidLoad() {
       // ...
       task = Task { @MainActor in
          let result = try await longOperation()
          doSomething(with: result)
       }
    }
}
```

If we look closely at this code, we may find some flaws, but the important thing here is to understand **the 4 don'ts of Swift Concurrency**:
1) **Don't be deceived by selfless tasks** - we don't see any `self` keyword inside of the Task. But `self` will be retained implicitly.
2) **Don't believe in try without catch** - this code will compile just fine. We call a throwing function and we don't catch any errors. So, in this case, if the longOperations throws an error, we won't get our result. And we won't get the error. It will be "silently suppressed". Task can accept throwing closures, so be careful and don't forget to catch your errors ;)
3) **Don't forget about the main thread** - in Swift Concurrency we don't operate threads directly, but it's important to keep in mind, that UI-related stuff must execute on the main thread. In Swift Concurrency we have Actors isolation mechanism that will make sure in compile time that certain code is executed on the main thread or outside of it. For the simplicity we can look at it as at a binary system: main/non-main thread. In this case inside the Task closure we have `@MainActor in`, which means that the execution **will start** on the main actor, when we `await` the `longOperation`, there will be a suspension point created and the work will be offloaded to one of the threads from the cooperative pool (**important!** only if the longOperation doesn't have MainActor isolation and if there's no funky business like DispatchQueue.main.async somewhere there all of a sudden. So, don't mix GCD with Swift Concurrency!). Then, once the operation has finished, we'll get back to the main actor and execute `doSomething` on the main (again, if there's no funky business involved).
4) **Don't make your self weak** - I have to look through a lot of code in my day-to-day work. And I often see how people are tempted to put `[weak self]` inside the Task just in case. And the next thing that they do is `guard let self else { return }`. We don't need that. There's no retain cycle there. Even if we hold the `task` in a property of `self` `Task` is not the one who holds the reference. The references are hold by Native.BuiltIn and once an executor finishes it's work (Task is finished/cancelled/error-thrown) the references will decrement and everything captured by it will be released (if nobody else is holding stuff). So, rather than putting `[weak self]` there, think of how and when you're gonna **cancel** the task. If you don't trust me, trust the guys who invented Swift Concurrency: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/c1ff2c339251c8adbdd63a08cb6ae45b339e15bd/stdlib/public/Concurrency/Task.swift#L80

We can't properly cover this topic without touching the concept of isolation. We'll dive deeper into it later.
For now, let's find an entry point to the Concurrency for our iOS projects.

### Swift UI Entry point

If you're using SwiftUI and you're targeting recent iOS versions, then Apple have done the heavy lifting for you. 

Each and every SwiftUI view has a `.task {}` [modifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/task(priority:_:)) or even [this one](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/task(id:priority:_:)). This can be your entry point. And for the most of the apps it will be enough. 
```Swift
struct MyView: View {

  var body: some View {
     Text("Hello there")
       .task {
          // here you go
          let result = await longOperation()
       }
  }
}
```

Apple suggest using View layer of your app to be an entry point to the concurrency. And if you're using `task(id:priority:_:)` you get Tasks cancellation for free. 

### UIKit Entry point

But if you're using UIKit, the heavy lifting is on you. Depending on how you organize the presentation layer management, you need to choose which part of it will become the entry point. Is it going to be a ViewController (A View layer)? Or a ViewModel from MVVM, Interactor from VIP, Presenter from VIPER, or any other fancy word of your choosing.

It is important to align with your team(s) on how you see it. Some may say that the tests coverage of Tasks cancellation is an absolute must. Then moving it from View layer makes sense, because testing Views is usually more cumbersome than other layers.

### Paradigm shift

Remember I mentioned a paradigm shift in the beginning? Here we go. 
If you choose your View layer to be an entry point, then it may make sense to get your ViewModels or Interactors an async interface. (Note: I'm omitting any kind of actor-isolation code deliberately.)
What does it mean to us as developers? It means that we enetered the Concurrency really early and we can benefit from async-awaiting our way up (or down, depending on how you look at it) the scene stack. If our networking code, or repositories, or image processors, or any other things that are usually async use Swift Concurrency, then we can simply those async entities. No need to create unstructured tasks anywhere else. And a nice bonus with SwiftUI, the tasks will be cancelled automatically by SwiftUI engine when the view goes off the hierarchy. This will cover 90% of our requirements.

```Swift
@Observable
final class TasksViewModel {
    private(set) var items: [Item]
    // ...
    func start() async {
       items = await repository.fetchAll()
    }
}

struct TasksView: View {

  var viewModel: TasksViewModel

  var body: some View {
     List(viewModel.items) { item
        ItemRow(item)
     }
     .task {
        await viewModel.start()
     }
  }
}
```
